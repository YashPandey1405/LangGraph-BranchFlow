# LangGraph-BranchFlow

A beginner-friendly demo of **LangGraph** showing how to build branching workflows with multiple nodes and edges.  
This project integrates **OpenAI** with conditional logic to handle **math vs non-math queries**, while also demonstrating preprocessing, postprocessing, and logging.
